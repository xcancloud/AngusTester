[//]: # (=====)

## Agile Development

Supports Scrum agile management, ensuring flexibility in development and testing, capable of rapidly responding to changes.

## Comprehensive Collaboration

All activities are tasks, supporting follow-up and management of development and testing activities such as requirements, stories, tasks, bugs (defects), interface testing, scenario testing, and functional testing.

## High Performance

Extremely high testing performance, with an overall performance improvement of over 30% compared to JMeter, capable of handling millions of concurrent connections and tens of millions of QPS performance scenarios for protocols such as Http and WebSocket.

## Distributed

In addition to single-machine testing, supports distributed environments and testing with hundreds of pressure testing nodes across different geographical regions.

## Automation

Can automatically generate test cases and scripts, as well as corresponding execution configurations based on test objectives and focus points.

## Intelligence

Allows querying knowledge bases, writing test cases, and scripts through AI intelligent assistant text interaction, simplifying workflows and improving work efficiency.

## Plugin-based

Greatly improves the customizability, extensibility, and maintainability of applications, allowing users to install and update plugins without upgrading the main application.

## Specification-based Testing

Unlike writing scripts in Python and C, AngusTester uses YAML and JSON text specifications to define scripts, making manual script writing simpler.

## Scenario Design

Compared to single-step testing, scenarios contain more steps and processes; additionally, users can replace manual script writing with the scenario design interface.

## API Asset Management

Treats backend development API results as important assets, and effectively manages and maintains them, such as online editing, debugging, and documenting interfaces.

## Multi-platform Interface Import

Supports import of multiple data formats including Swagger2.0, OpenAPI3.x, Postman2.0, Postman2.1, as well as custom import extensions.

## Service Simulation

Quickly generates and simulates the APIs you depend on, enabling development and testing to proceed first, achieving faster development and more comprehensive testing; also avoids dirty data issues caused by direct integration with production systems.

## Data Simulation

Supports rich data simulation functions, generating more realistic data compared to random data for system testing, service simulation, project demonstrations, and other scenarios.

## Metric Management

Supports setting of business performance metrics and test metrics (functional testing, performance testing, stability testing).

## KPI-oriented Assessment

Supports statistical analysis of performance indicators such as number of tasks, workload, overdue rate, first-time pass rate, and first-time review pass rate.

## Service Sharing

Multi-tenant support, providing comprehensive RestFul style APIs for easy integration with other CI systems or development systems.

## Achievement Sharing

Maximizes sharing of scripts, parameterized files, scenario designs, interfaces, reports, etc., among team members.

## Professional Reporting

Supports 16 types of business template settings and report generation for projects, functional testing, interface testing, scenario testing, task execution, etc.

## Extended Identity Management Support

In addition to built-in identity management, extends support for LDAP/Active Directory services and OAuth2 user single sign-on authentication.

## Security

Supports Https secure transmission protocol, data-level permission control, and policy-based access control (PBAC) permission schemes.
