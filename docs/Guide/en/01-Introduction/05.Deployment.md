[//]: # (=====)

AngusTester is committed to providing users with flexible and convenient testing deployment solutions to meet various needs and scenarios.

We offer multiple deployment methods, including standalone mode, cluster mode, Docker-Compose, and Kubernetes environment integration. Each method has its unique advantages, allowing users to choose based on their specific situations.

## I. Standalone Mode Deployment √

AngusTester's standalone mode deployment is a simple configuration suitable for small projects or personal development environments. In this mode, all components and services of AngusTester run on a single machine, making it easy for users to quickly set up a testing environment.

Advantages:

- Quick start: No complex cluster configuration required, enabling rapid setup of testing environments.
- Low resource consumption: Suitable for development and testing machines with limited resources.

Suitable scenarios:

- Personal and small team development testing environments.
- More convenient for individual developers and testers to learn, test, and verify on local machines.

## II. Cluster Mode Deployment √

AngusTester's cluster mode deployment is suitable for scenarios requiring higher availability and performance. In cluster mode, AngusTester's components and services are distributed across multiple machines, working together to improve system scalability and availability.

Advantages:

- High availability: Improves system availability by distributing across multiple machines.
- Scalability: Supports easy expansion of cluster scale based on demand.

Suitable scenarios:

- Team collaboration: Suitable for development and collaborative testing environments for medium-scale and above teams.
- Large-scale loads: Application scenarios handling large numbers of requests and data.

## III. Docker-Compose Deployment

AngusTester supports deployment through Docker-Compose, facilitating containerized environment setup. Docker-Compose can define and run multi-container Docker applications, simplifying the deployment process of multi-container applications.

Advantages:

- Simplified deployment: Use Docker-Compose to define services for the entire application and deploy with one click.
- Portability: Easy migration and deployment in different environments.

Suitable scenarios:

- Containerized environments: Suitable for development and testing processes based on container technology.

## IV. Kubernetes Environment Integration Deployment

AngusTester's Kubernetes environment integration deployment is designed to better utilize Kubernetes' container orchestration and automated management functions. AngusTester is containerized and uses Kubernetes for elastic scaling and automatic repair.

Advantages:

- Elastic scaling: Automatically expand or reduce application instances based on demand.
- Self-healing: Kubernetes automatically reschedules containers when containers or nodes fail.

Suitable scenarios:

- Microservices architecture: Suitable for applications based on microservices deployment.
- Continuous delivery: Used to implement fast and reliable application delivery processes.
