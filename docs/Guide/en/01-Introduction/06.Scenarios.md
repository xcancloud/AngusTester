[//]: # (=====)

## I. Agile Development and Testing

- Pain Points

  Frequent requirement changes; Poor communication; Lack of project transparency; Long delivery cycles; Difficulty in quality control.

- Solutions

  Respond flexibly to changes through iterative development and regular Sprint retrospectives, maintaining close communication with clients to adjust priorities. Establish daily stand-up meetings and use collaboration tools to facilitate real-time communication, ensuring information transparency. Implement kanban and progress tracking tools to display project status in real-time, allowing teams and stakeholders to clearly understand project dynamics. Incorporate automated test reviews to ensure high quality standards, conduct regular code reviews and integration tests to promptly identify and fix issues. Continuous integration and automated testing improve product quality and reduce defect rates.

## II. API Testing and Asset Management

- Pain Points

  Numerous APIs difficult to maintain; Inability to guarantee usability and reliability; Lack of security audits and monitoring; Low reusability of interfaces as fundamental capabilities.

- Solutions

  Through API asset management, treat internal APIs (or other forms of interfaces) as important assets and manage them effectively. Optimize API usability, reliability, reusability, and security to enhance their business value, enabling organizations to build and deliver new business services more flexibly, thereby stimulating business innovation and bringing significant economic benefits to enterprises. This strategic API management approach helps drive organizational digital transformation and business development.

## III. Test Case Library and Review Mechanism

- Pain Points

  Incomplete testing, unable to cover all functionalities and business scenarios, affecting product quality; Test teams often need to rewrite test cases due to personnel changes, resulting in resource waste and inefficiency; Problems often discovered late, increasing the cost and risk of fixing issues; Poor communication among team members, causing deviations in requirement understanding and collaboration issues.

- Solutions

  The test case library contains various scenarios and test cases, helping test teams conduct systematic testing and improve efficiency; Test cases can be reused, saving time and effort for the test team and improving test sustainability; The test case library serves as a shared resource for the team, promoting knowledge sharing and communication among team members, improving team collaboration efficiency. The review mechanism can identify and resolve potential issues and defects early, avoiding pushing problems to later stages that cause greater costs and impacts; The review process promotes communication and cooperation among team members, improving team cohesion and efficiency; Ensures consistent understanding of requirements among the team, avoiding problems caused by unclear requirements or misunderstandings.

## IV. Business-Centered Testing

- Pain Points

  Low testing efficiency with traditional testing tools; High requirements for testing skills and script writing; Unable to focus on key testing requirements; Cannot establish test case libraries and review mechanisms; Multiple and heavy testing tasks often lead to launch delays due to low efficiency.

- Solutions

  Conduct business-centered testing, simplifying test script writing as much as possible, lowering skill requirements for testers, allowing the testing team to focus more on verifying business logic; Meanwhile, reduce risks to business from security and usability issues, enabling the testing team to more effectively detect and fix defects, thereby improving overall software product quality. This approach helps optimize the testing process, improving team efficiency and business value.

## V. Sustainable Testing

- Pain Points

  Excessive manual testing workload; Slow follow-up when requirements or functions change frequently; Slow construction of quick tests or blocked by high-priority tasks; Unable to quickly perform regression and coverage testing due to time and resource limitations; Lack of shared test results and unified testing standards.

- Solutions

  Implement test resource pooling and parallel testing tasks, leveraging automated test scripts to provide quick and accurate instant test result feedback. This helps developers ensure their code changes don't break existing functionality, significantly increasing their confidence in code quality. Through this method, the testing process becomes more efficient, providing stronger support for the team.

## VI. Mock-based Preliminary Testing

- Pain Points

  Lack of clearer, easier-to-use interface designs in the early stages; Difficulty identifying potential defects and issues at the beginning of development; Unable to fully launch testing activities at the start due to heavy dependence on other functions or system services.

- Solutions

  Clearly define interface protocols and use case designs, documenting them to ensure the team has a shared understanding of expected functionality and behavior, allowing potential issues to be identified and resolved early in development. By adopting interface and data simulation techniques, use cases, interface, and scenario testing no longer depend on real services, enabling the test team to launch comprehensive testing activities at the project's inception. This method effectively improves testing efficiency, providing strong support for the project's smooth progress.

## VII. Observability of R&D and Testing Effectiveness

- Pain Points

  Enormous difficulty in overall assessment of test quality due to large-scale functionalities and interfaces; Unable to continuously and timely track quality changes and improvements; Cannot reasonably optimize the allocation and utilization of testing resources; Unable to increase the transparency of testing activities, build team trust, and reduce communication barriers; Lack of quantifiable assessment indicators for management.

- Solutions

  Centered on tasks, we provide flexible and intuitive collaboration tools aimed at helping teams collaborate more closely in complex testing environments. Through real-time updates, comments, and file sharing, team members can quickly respond to requirement changes, ensuring tasks progress smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, we provide key data including workload, processing times, pass rates, review times, and review pass rates, helping teams make better decisions and optimize overall testing strategies. This approach effectively improves work efficiency, ensuring the successful completion of testing tasks.
