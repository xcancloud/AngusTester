## I. Introduction

**AngusTester** (referred to as `AT`) helps software development teams efficiently and sustainably conduct software development and testing activities, while meeting the requirements of agile development and testing from users.

Core services include: software project management, functional testing, apis testing, scenario testing, service simulation, data simulation, reporting, and analysis.

Target users include: product owners, testers, developers, operations, and managers.

## II. Background

In a rapidly changing market environment, software development companies face challenges in meeting customer demands and delivering high-quality products. Traditional development methods require defining all requirements at the project's outset, which can be inflexible in the face of frequent changes, extending development cycles and potentially resulting in products that do not meet actual customer needs.

Software testing, as a key quality assurance process, is typically conducted after development is completed in traditional models, leading to delayed defect discovery and high remediation costs. This not only affects project efficiency but also impacts product quality.

With technological advancements, interface testing has shown significant advantages. Compared to unit testing and functional testing, interface testing can identify interaction issues between systems earlier, allowing for timely detection and resolution of potential defects. This enhances system stability and lays the foundation for subsequent development and user experience optimization.

Therefore, we position interface testing as a core component of software quality assurance, based on agile development and testing, to improve development efficiency and customer satisfaction, ensuring that delivered products truly meet user needs.

## III. Goals

In response to the above challenges, our goal is to enhance development and testing efficiency by 200%, with specific focuses on:

- Collaboration: Improving team understanding of development and testing progress through enhanced collaboration and process tracking.
- Intelligence: Utilizing AI to query knowledge bases, write test cases, and scripts, simplifying workflows and improving efficiency.
- Simplification: Reducing testing complexity and skill requirements, enabling performance and automation testing with simple training.
- Efficiency: Completing functional testing, performance testing, and stability testing for 100 interfaces in just a few hours.
